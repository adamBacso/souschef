## Overview

Cook time: 30

Difficulty: easy

## Ingredients

- Chicken breast filet: 500 g
- Pasta (fussili): 500 g
- Olive oil: 2 tbsp
- Butter: 1 tbsp
- Garlic: 2 cloves
- Flour: 2 tbsp
- Cream 30%: 500 ml
- Parmesan: 90 g
- Salt
- White pepper
- Parsley

## Instructions

1. Clean the chicken, cut into strips or cubes.

2. Cook the pasta in **salty**, boiling water. Put aside 1-2
   dl of its water.

3. Heat the oil and butter in a pan, add the chicken. Cook
   until white, maybe more. Also add salt and pepper while
   cooking, as seen fit. Put it aside when done.

4. In the same pan, add the _crushed_ garlic. After half a
   minute, add the flour and mix. Add the cream with
   constant stirring and wait until it reduces. **Do not let
   it boil!** Once reduced, add the cheese, then add salt
   and pepper to taste. If too dense, add pasta water. Wait
   until the cheese melts, then mix in the pasta and
   chicken.

5. Plate with fresh parsley.
